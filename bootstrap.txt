Bootstrap:

In the <head> section, link to bootstrap using:

<link rel="stylesheet" href="(newest version of bootstrap link)"

bootstrap page layout:

(see saved messages in telegram)

the grid is represented by 12 vertical bars
the boxes within them represent the HTML elements

container and jumbotron, along with col-sm-6 and col-sm-3, refer to bootstrap classes

"jumbotron" spans the whole screen and is wider than the border of the grid

col-sm-6 and col-sm-3 are labeled as such because they take up that number of grid columns

If you dont want to use the entirety of the screen use the class "conntainer." To refer to the columns in HTML: within the element, whether it be < header...> <body...>, you can reference the class by adding - class="container" - to create elements that align within a row use the HTML element <div...> then reference the class row - <div class = "row"> add whatever html element you want, such as a header, <h1.../>. in order to choose how long you want the element reference - class="col-sm-(insert number of rows you wish to span)". the HTML element should look similar to <h1 class="col-sm-4">Heading</h1>
