    BarMate is a platform with a broad collection of features for people and bar owners. Users are able to see menus, look at upcoming bar events, engage in a chat room with other people inside the bar, and more.

    BarMate offers solutions for bar owners as well. A problem we’ve seen  is that bar owners are not able to really obtain accurate data about things going on in their bar. BarMate’s solution to that is giving bar owners a way to see accurate data straight from BarMate that we call BarMate for Business.
